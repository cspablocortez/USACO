# USACO

Some solutions for USACO problems.

## Compilation in Java

In Java, class names correspond to file names. So if you are working on a project
with a class `Main` that looks like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        ...
    }
}
```

You will compile like this:

```sh
javac Main.java
```

To run the program, you run:

```sh
java Main
```
